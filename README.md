# UTvAustin, Course 2 Task 1
Getting Started With R

Hello,
 
Although we're generally happy with using RapidMiner as an analytics tool, many people in the industry seem to be moving to R, an open-source statistical programming language and analytics environment that is supported by a huge community of developers. Based on the excellent analysis work you have done thus far I have decided to ask you to explore introducing R into our current processes. To help you get started, I have obtained a walkthrough tutorial in R for you and a script of code to practice with.
 
Here are the things I would like you to do: 
 
Learn what R and RStudio are.
Install R and RStudio.
Learn how to work within RStudio.
Upload a data set into RStudio.
Install packages into RStudio.
Call a package in RStudio.
Perform basic exploratory data analysis.
Preprocess data.
Create test and training sets using your data.
Develop a linear regression model
Evaluate your model.
Use your model to make to make predictions.
 
I have attached the data sets that you'll be using for this task. I'll be expecting a report on your experience in a few days.
 
Thanks,
Danielle
